The sample sources come from Abuse.ch's MalwareBazaar and VX-Underground. Thanks to our partners Abuse.ch and VX-Underground for their contributions, allowing us to have substantial support in the area of Android malware samples.

## How to run
Train:
```
python permission_select.py train 
```
Predict:
```
python3 permission_select.py predict android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE android.permission.VIBRATE android.permission.INTERNET ...
```

## Future work
This model only achieves 85% accuracy rate even on our own test data. We are trying to add the data of behavior analysis to training. If we achieve better accuracy, we will continue to open source.
